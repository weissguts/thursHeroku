// # **Instructions**
//
// * When dealing with big databases, it is very likely that you will have to work with two or more datasets that are 
// related, but which have some degree of separation between them. In this case we have a table of the top 5000 songs 
// and a table of the top 3000 albums.
//
// * Emphasize the relationship between databases and tables: Tables live **in** databasesâ€”i.e., databases consist 
// of tables.
//
// * A **table** is a set of rows and columns. This set of rows and columns itself is _not_ a "database". We might, 
// however, have a database that consists of only a single table, but there remains a conceptual distinction between the
// database and the table.
//
// * It is your task to take these two large sets of data and come up with a method to join them together in order to 
// figure out if a given artist's song and album made it into the charts at the time of their release.
//
// * HINT: This can be done in a couple different ways using external data as well, but you do have all of the data you 
// need within your database to find the correlations. Give your methods some though before having to rely upon external info.
//
// * HINT: Remember that MySQL has the ability to combine two or more tables together so long as they share equivalent 
// data. What data is similar between the two lists?
//
// * Once you have managed to successfully bring the two datasets together, start making queries like those you made 
// earlier to this new table as well.
